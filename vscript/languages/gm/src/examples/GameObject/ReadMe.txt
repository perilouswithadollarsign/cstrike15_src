This example is simply one way to implement 'Game Objects'.  The example is a work in 
progress, and is included because some of the code may provide useful to look at.


TODO
o make 'triggers' and 'units'
o make IsUnitInSquare function to clip movement
o use states for units to be 'player' 'following' 'mental'
o make triggers that change unit color and triggers that create mental state if not player
o highlight player by color and allow player to cycle through units to control
